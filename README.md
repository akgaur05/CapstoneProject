Problem Statement

My fatherâ€™s company has difficulties managing bids for all of his clients that he service in his area. He needs to look out for records in his e-mail to check the last bid he made for the client.
The bid is then made from the scratch.


Solution

To make a system that will allow him to access client and his details like last bid made, discounts given, total amount etc so that he can make a new bid .
Also, for making a new bid, he will just need to enter some information and a pdf will be created with a new bid.
